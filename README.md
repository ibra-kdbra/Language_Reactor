# Performance Test

This repository contains an implementation of the `is_prime` function in multiple programming languages using the same algorithm. The goal is to compare the performance of different languages and runtimes.

## Usage

To run code in various programming languages, use the `run.sh` script:

```bash
./run.sh [LANGUAGE]
```

If no argument is provided, the script will run code in all supported languages. Otherwise, provide a language name to run the corresponding code.

### Supported Languages

- assembly
- c
- cpp
- rust
- go
- java
- nodejs
- csharp_mono
- dart
- python_codon
- pascal
- python
- php
- r
- [chap](https://github.com/ali77gh/Chap)

### Examples

```bash
# Run code in all supported languages
./run.sh

# Run specific language
./run.sh cpp
```

To display usage instructions and a list of supported languages, use the `--help` or `-h` flag:

```bash
./run.sh --help
```

If you want to add your own test results, simply run the `run.sh` script with your CPU model name and redirect the output to a file in the `result` directory.

See the [result directory](./result) for the output of running the tests on different CPUs.

Note: times are 5% more or less on different runs, so C and C++ can win sometimes.

The `n% Slower than Winner` column shows the percent difference between the time taken by each language and the fastest language (Assembly).

Formula: ((LanguageTime - WinnerTime) * 100) / WinnerTime
